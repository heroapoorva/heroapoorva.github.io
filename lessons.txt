CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

margin:- the distance outside

links

relative vs absolute path
the thing with link can be text, image, button, anything!

id for bookmark

Can make specific areas of a image clickable and link them to other ids, links
For pressing specific parts of the image can call javascript functions
Can specify background images, for specific parts of page or the entire page
If the images used is smaller than element, it will repeat. can stop the repeat using a flag
Can use flags to scale the images to cover the entire element/ frame where it is set to appear.
Depending on the window size, you can change the image displayed, using "picture". It goes from top to bottom. if it sees a unknown format, ignores it.


Different types of tables, latex like table properties.

list, bullet points/ dash/ nothing/ square, numbered, nested lists
Kinda like itemize
HORIZONTAL LISTS!

Can define custom classes, which have styles etc associated with them in the head
Can define javascript function so get all the elements of a particular class, basically an iterator. 
                                    var x = document.getElementsByClassName("city");
now given you can loop over each of them, can make them disappear using
                                 x[i].style.display = "none";
                         <script>
                        function myFunction() {
                          var x = document.getElementsByClassName("city");
                          for (var i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
                            x[i].style.display = "none";
                          }
                        }
                        </script>
